Create a class scheduler application, where a school principal can assign teachers to different class timeslots.
     -Monday to Friday
     -The timeslots are from 
     -6:00am to 7:00am
     -7:00am to 8:00am
     -8:00am to 9:00am
     -9:00am to 9:10am is a break
     -9:10am to 10:10am
     -10:10am to 11:10am
     -11:10am to 12:10pm
     -12:10pm to 12:15pm is a break
     -12:15pm to 1:15pm
     -1:15pm to 2:15pm


There should be an interface where the principal can add teachers and advisers

There should be a table for the timeslots and schedule

     - Each adviser can only be assigned to 5  timeslot
     - Each teacher can only be assigned to 6  timeslot
